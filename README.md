This repository includes tips and best practices for managing your CloudPanel installation securely. Please follow the steps below based on your usage type (personal or business).

### ðŸ”’ Port 8443 Security Advice

CloudPanelâ€™s web-based management interface runs on port `8443`. To secure this, we advise:

1. **For Personal Use:**  
   - **Close Port 8443** to the public internet to prevent unauthorized access.
   - Use firewall rules to **allow only specific IP addresses** to access port 8443, such as your personal IP or VPN IP. This reduces the risk of brute-force attacks and unauthorized access.

   **Example**: Configure UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) with specific IP access.
   ```bash
   # Allow access to port 8443 only from a specific IP
   sudo ufw allow from <YOUR_TRUSTED_IP> to any port 8443
